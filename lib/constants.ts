  name: 'Adam L Patterson',
  title: 'Economist and Data Science Engineer',
  bio: 'I operate at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning, where I build end-to-end automated models that turn complex data into actionable policy and business insights. Currently, as an Economist Apprentice at Amazon and a Research Technician at UConn, I specialize in bridging the gap between academic rigor and industrial scale, developing at pace. I leverage Python, Gen AI, SQL, and AWS to solve complex problems through a blend of engineering and statistical precision, always with an eye toward outsized business impact.',
