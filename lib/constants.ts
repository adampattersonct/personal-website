  title: 'Economist and Data Scientist',
  bio: 'I am an Economist Apprentice at Amazon and a Research Technician at the University of Connecticut. My work lives at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning, where I focus on building end-to-end automated models that translate complex data into actionable policy and business insights. Currently, I am bridging the gap between academic research and industry application, leveraging Python, SQL, and AWS to solve high-stakes problems. I am actively seeking doctoral opportunities and collaborative research roles that push the boundaries of applied economics.',
